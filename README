A quick description of the content of this repo.

FILES:

APOD.pm:
	A Perl module for accessing the Astronomy Picture Of the Day as
	well as its description.

apod_get:
	A Perl script which saves the image and description file either of
	todays APOD, or the APOD specified by an optional URL argument. 
	It also has an archiving mode, which stores the files in
	~/.APOD/ and keeps the latest files symlinked to ~/.APOD/latest/.

apod_getrss:
	A perl script which saves the image and description files for each APOD
	provided by NASAs APOD RSS feed into the current directory. Note that
	this doesn't have an archive mode like apod_get.

apod_setbg:
	A bash script which generates a resized (to your desktop or a custom 
	size, by using linnea_annotate) and optionally annotated image which it 
	then sets as the desktop background.

linnea_annotate:
	A text annotator written in Perl. It takes an input image and text,
	annotates the text onto it and produces an output image. It can do some
       	helping stuff, like automatically create an output image which is the 
	same size as the current desktop. Although this turned out as a part of 
	the APOD code, it's now a standalone program which might be practical
	outside of this context.

font/:
	A free truetype font.

NOTES:

For the scripts to run, the perl module and scripts need to be accessible via
@INC and $PATH (ie, they need to be globally installed or run from the same
directory as the files are in)	       

linnea_annotate (used by apod_setbg) can't determine the desktop size
(the '--desktop-size' option) if it's run from an other user, etc, since it
needs all your environment variables. If you want to run apod_setbg from say a
crontab, I suggest you just edit the script to set a static size using the
'--size' option.

You can modify how the background is to be set by looking at the 
"background_set" subroutine at the top of apod_setbg.
