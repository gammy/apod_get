A quick description of the content of this repo.

FILES:

APOD.pm:
	A Perl module for accessing the Astronomy Picture Of the Day as
	well as its description.

apod_get:
	A Perl script which, by using APOD.pm, saves the image and 
	description file in the current directory.

apod_get_rss:
	Does what apod_get does, but for each entry in the APOD RSS, 
	which usually contains a weeks worth of APODs.

apod_desktop:
	A bash script for setting an annotated version of the APOD image
	as the desktop background. In essence it runs apod_get in a 
	specific directory(~/.APOD/new/) and then annotates the APOD
	description to the image (into ~/.APOD/) via linnea_annotate.
	It then sets the background via any method set in
	background_set() (see the script itself to change it).

linnea_annotate:
	Although this turned out as a part of the APOD code, it's now
	completely unrelated and should probably be moved to its own
	repository.

	It's a basic text annotator. It takes an input image and text,
	annotates the text onto it and produces an output image.
	It can do some helping stuff, like automatically create an output
	image which is the same size as the current desktop.

font/:
	A free truetype font.

NOTES:

Most of this stuff assumes that the files are globally installed, meaning
that APOD.pm needs to go into your perl module path.

For apod_desktop to run, apod_desktop and linnea_annotate need to be
globally installed (in, say, /usr/local/bin/ or the like).

Running apod_desktop, or linnea_annotate with --desktop-size, from a cronjob
or screen will probably fail:

The --desktop-size option of linnea_annotate (which is used by apod_desktop) 
won't work if you're not running from an other user of if your DISPLAY
environment variable isn't set. You can get around this by using --size
to set the desired output resolution.

The program which is to set your background image(called by set_background
at the top of apod_desktop) will probably have the same requirements.
One workaround is to write your custom desktop script.
