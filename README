A quick description of the content of this repo.

FILES:

APOD.pm:
	A Perl module for accessing the Astronomy Picture Of the Day as
	well as its description.

apod_get:
	A Perl script which saves the image and description file either of
	todays APOD, or the APOD specified by an optional URL argument. 
	It also has an archiving mode, which creates a 'latest/'-subdirectory
       	in the download path which contains symlinks to the downloaded files.

apod_getrss:
	A Perl script which saves the image and description files for each APOD
	provided by NASAs APOD RSS feed into the current directory.

apod_setbg:
	A bash script which generates a resized (to your desktop or a custom 
	size, by using linnea_annotate) and optionally annotated image which it 
	then sets as the desktop background.

apod_archive_setbg:
	Literally two lines of code: runs apod_get --archive and apod_setbg.
	It takes an APOD URL as an optinal argument.
	This can be called from a crontab if a size is specified by adding
	a '--size'-argument to the last line (calling apod_setbg)

linnea_annotate:
	A text annotator written in Perl; it produces a scaled and annotated 
	copy of a supplied image. Although this turned out as a part of the 
	APOD code, it's now a generally useful standalone program for creating
	captioned images.

font/:
	A free truetype font.

NOTES:

For the scripts to run, the Perl module and scripts need to be accessible via
@INC and $PATH (ie, they need to be globally installed or run from the same
directory as the files are in)	       

linnea_annotate (used by apod_setbg) can't automatically determine the desktop
size (the '--desktop-size' option) if it's run from an other user since it needs
all your environment variables and such to do it. Use the '-s'-option for 
apod_setbg to set the desktop dimension manually.

linnea_annotate will also need the path to a font, which is unfortunate as it
is currently hardcoded into apod_setbg. Sorry about that ;)

You can modify how the background is to be set by changing the "background_set" 
subroutine at the top of apod_setbg.
